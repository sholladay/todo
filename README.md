To ask a question, see my [AMA](https://github.com/sholladay/ama "Ask Me Anything").

For help and support, see my [guides](https://github.com/sholladay/guides) or [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com).

Bug reports and feature requests belong on the relevant issue tracker for a given project. Generally, `https://github.com/sholladay/<my-project>/issues` where `<my-project>` should be replaced with the actual name of a project.

## Why?

I wanted a list where:

 - Other people can collaborate on ideas, share opinions, and help me prioritize.
 - I can make the list public or private, temporarily or permanently.
 - I can describe tasks with [Markdown](https://markdowntutorial.com/).
 - I can [mark tasks as done](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-using-keywords/) from commits, even across repositories.
